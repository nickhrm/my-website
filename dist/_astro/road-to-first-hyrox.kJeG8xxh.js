# Weekly Training Recap

This past week was packed with a variety of training sessions focusing on endurance, strength, and recovery. Below is a breakdown of the workouts I completed each day, with explanations for some of the more specialized terms.

## Monday:
    Running: Easy steady-state session (SS2) for 1 hour.
    Explanation: SS2 refers to a steady-state workout at a pace that is sustainable for a long time, typically moderate intensity to build aerobic endurance.

## Tuesday:
    SkiErg: Red Max Intervals, 2 sets of 1:30 minutes, with 4 minutes rest between each set.
    Explanation: The SkiErg machine simulates the motion of Nordic skiing, focusing on upper body and core strength. Red Max Intervals are designed to push the body to its maximum aerobic capacity for short bursts.
    Running: Red Threshold Intervals, 4 sets of 4 minutes.
    Explanation: Red Threshold Intervals are high-intensity runs aimed at improving your lactate threshold, or the point at which your muscles start to fatigue from lactic acid buildup.

## Wednesday:
    RowErg: Tempo Intervals.
    Explanation: The RowErg is similar to the SkiErg but simulates rowing. Tempo Intervals involve sustaining a challenging pace for several intervals, focusing on both aerobic endurance and technique.
    Deadlift: Recovery sets, 2 sets of 125kg.
    Explanation: Deadlifting is a fundamental strength exercise that targets the posterior chain (back, glutes, hamstrings). These recovery sets are lighter and used for technique refinement and muscle maintenance.

## Thursday:
    Squat: 3-5 Rule, 3 sets of 125kg.
    Explanation: The 3-5 Rule is a strength training principle where each set consists of 3 to 5 repetitions at a heavy weight. This approach builds both strength and muscle mass.
    Pendlay Row: 3-5 Rule, 5 sets of 100kg.
    Explanation: The Pendlay Row is a type of bent-over row where the barbell starts and ends on the ground for each rep, promoting explosive strength in the upper back.

## Friday:
A circuit that includes:

    Running: 1km at steady-state pace (SS2)
    Burpee Broad Jump: 80 meters
    Lunges: 100 meters
    Squats: 100 bodyweight squats

This combination of running and bodyweight exercises is designed for functional conditioning, targeting the legs, cardiovascular system, and full-body strength.
Saturday:

    RowErg: Tempo Intervals
    Deadlift: Recovery sets, 2 sets of 125kg.

## Sunday:
Rest day

Conclusion

This week of training incorporated a balance of cardio, high-intensity intervals, and strength work, capped off with appropriate recovery. Whether it's building endurance on the RowErg or SkiErg or pushing strength limits with deadlifts and squats, each session contributes to long-term fitness gains.
