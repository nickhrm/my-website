Credits: This training program is largely based on the training recommendations of Joel Jamieson. The most important blog posts from my point of view are the following:
- [The Ultimate Conditioning Template](https://8weeksout.com/2018/08/23/the-ultimate-conditioning-template/) 
- [A better way to build programs: understanding the stress-recovery cycle](https://8weeksout.com/2021/04/04/stress-recovery-cycle/)

The program consists of 3 different types of training sessions, which differ in intensity
1. development training: this day is about giving 100%. At the end of the training you must feel really ready and have the feeling that you will feel your body tomorrow.
2. stimulate training: this day is all about stimulating your body. You should feel good after training and have the feeling that you can give 100% again the next day.
3. recovery training: This day is all about regenerating your body. You should feel better after training than before. 



## Stimulate Training 1: Strength
This day is all about increasing your strength. The best way to do this is to choose 3 full-body exercises. Do 3-5 sets of 3-5 repetitions for each of these exercises. The breaks between sets should be 3-5 minutes. This workout follows the [3-5 Rule by Andy Galpin](https://youtu.be/CyDLbrZK75U?t=4373).

## Development Training 1: Intervals
This day is all about improving your endurance with different intervals. You can choose 1 or more intervals from the following list:
- 4x4 minutes 100% effort, 4 minutes rest
- 1:30 minutes 100% effort, 1:30 minutes rest
- 30 seconds 100% effort, 30 seconds rest

There are endless possibilities for how you can design intervals. The important thing is that at the end of the workout you feel that you have given it your all. 


## Recovery Training 1: Recover
How to design this workout is explained in this blog post by Joel Jamieson: [How to Train to Recover Faster Than Ever](https://8weeksout.com/2017/11/29/train-recover-faster-ever-new-science-high-performance-recovery-training/)


## Stimulate Training 2: Base Run
This day is all about improving your base endurance. To do this, you run for 60-90 minutes at a moderate pace. This means that you can still talk while you run. This pace is also known as Zone 2 training.


## Development Training 2: Hyrox Simulation
On this day you simulate a Hyrox competition. To do this, you choose 5-8 exercises that you complete one after the other. You run one kilometer between the exercises. The exercises should be the same as in the Hyrox competition.

## Recovery Training 2: Recover
This workout is the same as the 1st recovery workout.
